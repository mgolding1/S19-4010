1. Google is working to make blockchains searchable.
2. Facebook has a large development group to create a high-speed blockchain payments system.
3. Kantpoll - Open source election management system based on Ethereum.


2nd. Purpose of a business

4. More on Go

Maps do not synchronize automatically.
So... Synchronization Primitives:

```Go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// SafeCounter is safe to use concurrently.
type SafeCounter struct {
	v   map[string]int
	mux sync.Mutex
}

// Inc increments the counter for the given key.
func (c *SafeCounter) Inc(key string) {
	c.mux.Lock()
	// Lock so only one goroutine at a time can access the map c.v.
	c.v[key]++
	c.mux.Unlock()
}

// Value returns the current value of the counter for the given key.
func (c *SafeCounter) Value(key string) int {
	c.mux.Lock()
	// Lock so only one goroutine at a time can access the map c.v.
	defer c.mux.Unlock()
	return c.v[key]
}

func main() {
	c := SafeCounter{v: make(map[string]int)}
	for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
		go c.Inc("somekey")
	}

	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	fmt.Println(c.Value("somekey"))
}


```

### A Go Core/Panic 

First the Code

```Go
	package main

	import "fmt"

	var mm map[string]int

	func main() {
		fmt.Println("vim-go")
		mm["bob"] = 3
	}
```

Then the bad output.


```
