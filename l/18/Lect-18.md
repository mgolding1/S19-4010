The initiative is reportedly the result of a partnership between technology non-profit Kiva, the U.N. Capital
Development Fund (UNCDF), and the U.N. Development Programme (UNDP). The new system is intended to tackle two major
barriers that many citizens face when they attempt to access financial services – these being a lack of both formal
identification and a verifiable credit history. As the press release outlines:

“Currently, unbanked people cannot leverage financial transactions from the 'informal economy,' such as credit with a
local shopkeeper, to build their credit history. The Kiva Protocol will capture a wide range of financial transactions
… to help people access the financial services they need, including loans for businesses, education or basic medical
services.”

## Accounting - Double Entry

Basics of Double Entry accounting.

From wikipdia.com: "The oldest European record of a complete double-entry system is the Messari (Italian: Treasurer's)
accounts of the Republic of Genoa in 1340. The Messari accounts contain debits and credits journalised in a bilateral
form, and include balances carried forward from the preceding year, and therefore enjoy general recognition as a
double-entry system."

Some indication this may be from Korea around the year 926

## When was Zero Invented

From the 13th century, manuals on calculation (adding, multiplying, extracting roots, etc.) became common in Europe
where they were called algorismus after the Persian mathematician al-Khwārizmī. The most popular was written by
Johannes de Sacrobosco, about 1235 and was one of the earliest scientific books to be printed in 1488. Until the late
15th century, Hindu–Arabic numerals seem to have predominated among mathematicians, while merchants preferred to use
the Roman numerals. In the 16th century, they became commonly used in Europe.

## Where were negative numbers invented.

Western mathematicians accepted the idea of negative numbers by the 17th century. Prior to the concept of negative
numbers, mathematicians such as Diophantus considered negative solutions to problems "false" and equations requiring
negative solutions were described as absurd.
