# Personal Security - Why

Tell a story - AWS.

Why is this happening?

Systems that survive pay out to all the responsible parties in proportion
to the level of responsibility.

"The Tragedy of the Commons"

## Friction vs Access

Friction to get to the information you want is security to prevent unauthorized
people from getting to the information that you don't want them to get to.

People will choose convenience over security every time.

Data ownership.  Equafax and what data you have as public.

### Passwords

Top 10 List
```
		123456
		123456789
		qwerty
		12345678
		111111
		1234567890
		1234567
		password
		123123
		987654321
```
Represent 76% of passwords in use.

Top 10000 passwords are 92% of passwords in use.

Hash passwords: MD5, SHA1

Rainbow Tables

Salt and then Hash

use a hash that is appropriate: bcrypt, scrypt, or PBKDF2.

1. Generated Passwords ( 1password or other similar tools ).
```
#!/bin/bash
openssl rand -base64 20
```
2. Never change passwords
3. Write it down.
4. Use a system that verifies that your password is not pwned.


### Other security systems good/bad.

1. Auth0 - JWT
2. Password-less login systems
3. Biometrics
4. Biometrics that works
5. NFC
6. Wireless WiFi and security
7. IOT
8. Back doors into systems
9. Chipping dogs - why not people?
10. Software is never 100% fixed.

### Security == Friction

"Making Password Cracking Harder: Slow Hash Functions"
Proof of Work: PBKDF2.

Risk of pandemic is really an airline - high speed transpiration
system.

Speed Limits: highways - approaches to airports.
Drugs - require prescriptions.

Digital information moves limitlessly. The same design philosophy that
accelerated the flow of correspondence, news, and commerce also accelerate
the flow of phishing, ransomware, and disinformation.

### Free isn't free.

Sherman Antitrust Act: 1989 Supreme Court Decision - that evaluation of 
an illegitimate merger be based on price of goods produced.  
We are now in a world where 0 price is common.

So if you give away your product (e.g. Facebook) then you purchase some
other entity (Instagram) and give it away for free then the SAA will not
apply to you.

### Who Pays.

During the height of the recession, in 2009, we wasted 6.3 billion hours on the road. 

Capitalism is suffering from its own success.
