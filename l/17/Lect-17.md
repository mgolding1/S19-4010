What is Insurance? What do Insurance Companies do?

In insurance, the insurance policy is a contract (generally a standard form contract) between the insurer and the
insured, known as the policyholder, which determines the claims which the insurer is legally required to pay. In
exchange for an initial payment, known as the premium, the insurer promises to pay for loss caused by perils covered
under the policy language.

1. Identify Risks and Markets
2. Manage payments
2. Provide Initial Capital 
4. Pay out claims - Pay out on terms of insurance
