# How is Wealth Created

•	"Matt Luongo "Any detailed project in Crypto is inevitably going to lead into politics. 
You can't talk about money without involving politics."



Zero Sum Game - C. Marx

	“The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that
	which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.”

How is Wealth Created?

	Measurement and Leverage.

	Why do corpate officers and sales people make a gob of money?

	Why rental property will create wealth over time.

No!

Most wealth has been historically created through trade, mines, serfs and slaves.
