Economics of Wealth
======================

1. How is Wealth Created
	1. What is your time worth
		- $100,000 per year in 5 years
		- 2x - you work twice as hard ( 80+ hrs a week )
		- 3x - you are 3 times as productive becasue you "skip the bs"
		- 3x - you work on someting important - an actual technology with productivity benefits
		= 18x as much

		This means 18 x 100,000 = 1.8 Mill a year = for a couple of years.

	2. What are the risks
		- Bad product market fit
		- Can't raise capital
		- Wrong people
		- Business Fails
	
	"Leaverage" * "Measurability" = Wealth

	Leaverage is Technology
		Leaverage is New finanical instrument
		Leaverage is Other peoples money
