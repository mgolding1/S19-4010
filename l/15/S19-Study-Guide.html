<h1>Sprint 2019  Study Guide For Midterm</h1>

<h2>Terms with explanation</h2>

<p>The mid term test is on Friday, March 15. All You need to bring to class that day are a
couple of pens or pencils.  Standard Academic rules apply. The test will be 20 multiple
choice/ fill in the blank. An example follows:</p>

<pre><code>5. [10pt] The purpose of financial markets is to: &lt;br&gt;
	A. Increase the price of common stocks. &lt;br&gt;
	B. Control inflation. &lt;br&gt;
	C. Lower the yield on bonds. &lt;br&gt;
	D. Allocate savings efficiently. &lt;br&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>These are the terms you will need to study. The terms come from our in-class
lectures and discussions,  looking over your notes from class will be useful.</p>

<p>There will be 4 or 5 coding questions after the multiple choice section.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Cash: Cash is also known as money, in physical form. Cash, in a corporate
setting, usually includes bank accounts and marketable securities, such as
government bonds and banker&rsquo;s acceptances. Although cash typically refers to
money in hand, the term can also be used to indicate money in banking accounts,
checks or any other form of currency that is easily accessible and can be
quickly turned into physical cash.
<br><br>
Cash in its physical form is the simplest, most broadly accepted and reliable
form of payment, which is why many businesses only accept cash. Checks can
bounce and credit  cards can be declined, but cash in hand requires no extra
processing. However, it&rsquo;s become less common for people to carry cash with them,
due to the increasing dependability and convenience of electronic banking and
payment systems.
<br><br>
In finance and banking, cash indicates the company&rsquo;s current assets, or any
assets that can be turned into cash within one year. A business&rsquo;s cash flow
shows the net amount of  cash a company has, after factoring in both incoming
and outgoing cash and assets, and can be a good resource for potential
investors. A company&rsquo;s cash flow statement shows all  incoming cash, such as net
income, and outgoing cash used to pay expenses such as equipment and
investments.</p></li>

<li><p>Stock: You have probably heard a popular definition of what a stock is: “A
stock is a share in the ownership of a company. Stock represents a claim on the
company&rsquo;s assets and earnings. As you acquire more stock, your ownership stake
in the company becomes greater.” Unfortunately, this definition is incorrect
in some key ways.
<br><br>
To start with, stock holders do not own corporations; they own shares issued by
corporations. But corporations are a special type of organization because the
law treats them as legal persons. In other words, corporations file taxes, can
borrow, can own property, can be sued, etc. The idea that a corporation is a
“person” means that the corporation owns its own assets. A corporate office
full of chairs and tables belong to the corporation, and not to the
shareholders.
<br><br>
This distinction is important because corporate property is legally separated
from the property of shareholders, which limits the liability of both the
corporation and the shareholder. If the corporation goes bankrupt, a judge may
order all of its assets sold – but your personal assets are not at risk. The
court cannot even force you to sell your shares, although the value of your
shares will have fallen drastically. Likewise, if a major shareholder goes
bankrupt, she cannot sell the company’s assets to pay off her creditors.
<br><br>
What shareholders own are shares issued by the corporation; and the corporation
owns the assets. So if you own 33% of the shares of a company, it is incorrect
to assert that you own one-third of that company; it is instead correct to state
that you own 100% of one-third of the company’s shares. Shareholders cannot do
as they please with a corporation or its assets. A shareholder can’t walk out
with a chair because the corporation owns that chair, not the shareholder. This
is known as the “separation of ownership and control.”</p></li>

<li><p>What is a P&amp;L: The profit and loss statement is a financial statement that
summarizes the revenues, costs and expenses incurred during a specified period,
usually a fiscal quarter or year. P&amp;L statement is synonymous with the income
statement. These records provide information about a company&rsquo;s ability or
inability to generate profit by increasing revenue, reducing costs or both. Some
refer to the P&amp;L statement as a statement of profit and loss, income statement,
statement of operations, statement of financial results or income, earnings
statement and expense statement.
<br><br>
P&amp;L statement is synonymous with the income statement. The income statement
summarizes income and expenses. These records provide information about a
company&rsquo;s ability or inability to generate profit by increasing revenue,
reducing costs or both The balance sheet shows assets, liabilities, and
owner’s equity. The cash flow statement summarizes your incoming and outgoing
money from operations, investing, and financing.
<br><br>
Income statement vs. balance sheet: The income statement answers whether the
business is profitable whereas the balance sheet shows what a company is owed
and what it owns.</p></li>

<li><p>Long on Cash, Long in a Stock : this means that you have lots of cash,
or that you own some of a stock. A long (or long position) is the buying of
a security such as a stock, commodity or currency with the expectation that the
asset will rise in value. In the context of options, long is the buying of an
options contract. An investor that expects an asset’s price to fall will go
long on a put option, and an investor that hopes to benefit from an upward price
movement will be long a call option.
<br><br>
Very often you will read in a &ldquo;disclosure&rdquo; section that a person is &ldquo;Long on
&hellip;, &hellip;&ldquo;. This is to disclose that if they are saying good things about a company
that they have a self-interest in you purchasing shares in the company.  For a
person writing professionally this is a legal requirement.</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;Take a position in&rdquo;&hellip; The state of owning or owing a security or other
asset. One has a long position when one owns something, while one has a short
position when something is sold, especially sold short.</p></li>

<li><p>Real Estate: Land and the improvements on it. Real estate is one of the
primary (and indeed one of the only) assets whose value does not depreciate over
time. Depending on the particular title, ownership of real estate may include
mineral rights to any geophysical aspects occurring thereon. Ownership of real
estate does not automatically include the right to develop it, depending on
local regulations. However, development of real estate (for example by building
a house on it) usually increases the value. While supply of real estate does not
vary, demand may change greatly depending on its particular features, number of
people in the area, and cultural differences regarding land ownership. It is an
attractive form of collateral because it cannot be stolen or destroyed.</p></li>

<li><p>What is Inflation? Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices
for goods and services is rising and, consequently, the purchasing power of
currency is falling. Central banks attempt to limit inflation — and avoid
deflation — in order to keep the economy running smoothly.</p></li>

<li><p>REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) - legally required to pay out 80% of
profits to investors. A real estate investment trust, or REIT, is a company that
owns, operates or finances income-producing real estate. For a company to
qualify as a REIT, it must meet certain regulatory guidelines. REITs often
trades on major exchanges like other securities and provide investors with a
liquid stake in real estate.</p></li>

<li><p>Price to Earnings Radio - In essence, the price-earnings ratio indicates the
dollar amount an investor can expect to invest in a company in order to receive
one dollar of that company&rsquo;s earnings. This is why the P/E is sometimes referred
to as the price multiple because it shows how much investors are willing to pay
per dollar of earnings.
<br><br>
There will be a question on how to calculate a PE ratio on the test.  The formula
for calculating it will be on the test.</p></li>

<li><p>What is a Derivative? In finance, a derivative is a contract that derives
its value from the performance of an underlying entity. This underlying entity
can be an asset, index, or interest rate, and is often simply called the
&ldquo;underlying.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>High speed trading: High-frequency trading - HFT is a program trading
platform that uses powerful computers to transact a large number of orders at
fractions of a second. It uses complex algorithms to analyze multiple markets
and execute orders based on market conditions. Typically, the traders with the
fastest execution speeds are more profitable than traders with slower execution
speeds.</p></li>

<li><p>Dividends: A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a company&rsquo;s
earnings, decided by the board of directors, paid to a class of its
shareholders. Dividends can be issued as cash payments, as shares of stock, or
other property.</p></li>

<li><p>What is the &ldquo;Yield&rdquo;? In finance, the yield on a security is the amount of
cash (in percentage terms) that returns to the owners of the security, in the
form of interest or dividends received from it. Normally, it does not include
the price variations, distinguishing it from the total return.
<br><br>
There will be a question on calculating the Yield from the stock price and
the amount of dividends on the test.</p></li>

<li><p>What is a basis point (BPS)? Example 50 BSP = 0.5%: Basis points, otherwise
known as bps or &ldquo;bips,&rdquo; are a unit of measure used in finance to describe the
percentage change in the value or rate of a financial instrument. One basis
point is equivalent to 0.01% (1/100th of a percent) or 0.0001 in decimal form.
<br><br>
There will be a question of converting 75 BSP to a percentage on the test.</p></li>

<li><p>Stock Buy Back: A stock buyback, or repurchase, occurs when a company buys
its own shares off the market and therefore reduces the amount of stock
outstanding. It can do this in one of two ways: The company can either buy
shares at current market prices or tender a fixed-price offer to current
shareholders.
<br><br>
Stock buy backs are a good indication that the company believes that its
stock is a good investment.  Also this is a way for the company to directly
influence the price of the stock.  Fewer shares sell for more for each share.
This also will increase the dividends that are payd out.
<br><br>
Stock buy backs are a bad thing when the company has to borrow to pay for
them.</p></li>

<li><p>Index Fund: An index fund is a type of mutual fund with a portfolio
constructed to match or track the components of a market index, such as the
Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500 Index (S&amp;P 500). An index mutual fund is said to provide
broad market exposure, low operating expenses and low portfolio turnover.</p></li>

<li><p>Insider Trading: Insider trading is the trading of a public company&rsquo;s stock
or other securities (such as bonds or stock options) by individuals with access
to nonpublic information about the company. In various countries, some kinds of
trading based on insider information is illegal.</p></li>

<li><p>Bonds: A bond is a fixed income investment in which an investor loans money
to an entity (typically corporate or governmental) which borrows the funds for a
defined period of time at a variable or fixed interest rate. &hellip; Owners of bonds
are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer.</p></li>

<li><p>ICOs (Initial Coin Offering): An initial coin offering or initial currency
offering is a type of funding using cryptocurrencies. Mostly the process is done
by crowdfunding but private ICO&rsquo;s are becoming more common.</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;Industrial Staker Sale&rdquo; a token sale under a different name that isn&rsquo;t ICO.</p></li>

<li><p>Proof-of-Work describes a system that requires a not-insignificant but
feasible amount of effort in order to deter frivolous or malicious uses of
computing power, such as sending spam emails or launching denial of service
attacks.
<br><br>
In blockchain a proof of work is a race that is payed for to get a reward.
This is how Bitcoin has been distributed.</p></li>

<li><p>Proof-of-Stake concept states that a person can mine or validate block
transactions according to how many coins he or she holds. This means that the
more Bitcoin or altcoin owned by a miner, the more mining power he or she has.
<br><br>
The &ldquo;stake&rdquo; is at risk when mining occurs.  If the miner lies then it looses
some or all of its stake.</p></li>

<li><p>&ldquo;Consumer Token Sale&rdquo;: Token sales are, quite simply, a process of
generating and selling a new cryptocurrency. While the details change from sale
to sale, this process involves building a smart contract on the blockchain,
generating, and then selling the resulting coins.</p></li>

<li><p>Junk Bonds refers to high-yield or non-investment-grade bonds. Junk bonds are
fixed-income instruments that carry a credit rating of BB or lower by Standard &amp;
Poor&rsquo;s, or Ba or below by Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service. Junk bonds are so called
because of their higher default risk in relation to investment-grade bonds.</p></li>

<li><p>Mutual Fund is an investment vehicle made up of a pool of money collected
from many investors for the purpose of investing in securities such as stocks,
bonds, money market instruments and other assets. &hellip; A mutual fund&rsquo;s portfolio
is structured and maintained to match the investment objectives stated in its
prospectus.
<br><br>
Mutual funds have both a managed and an index variety.  Usually the costs of
a managed mutual fund and the tax that you pay on it will make it less
profitable than an index fund.  Consider the returns on the Vanguard S&amp;P
500 index fund over the last 25 years.  Only 1% of managed mutual funds have
out performed the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 Fund.</p></li>

<li><p>Asset allocation refers to the strategy of dividing your investments among
different asset categories, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, cash, and cash
alternatives. Asset allocation aims to control risk by diversifying an
investment portfolio.</p></li>

<li><p>Expense Ratio for a Mutual Fund. The expense ratio, also known as the
management expense ratio (MER), measures how much of a fund&rsquo;s assets are used
for administrative and other operating expenses. An expense ratio is determined
by dividing a fund&rsquo;s operating expenses by the average dollar value of its
assets under management (AUM).</p></li>

<li><p>Prospectus. A prospectus, in finance, is a disclosure document that
describes a financial security for potential buyers. &hellip; In the context of an
individual securities offering, such as an initial public offering, a prospectus
is distributed by underwriters or brokerages to potential investors.</p></li>

<li><p>Pro Forma: Pro forma is a Latin term that describes a method of calculating
and presenting financial results to emphasize either current or projected
figures. Pro forma literally means “for the sake of form” or “as a matter
of form.” In the world of investing, pro forma refers to a method by which
firms calculate financial results. This method of calculation emphasizes present
or projected figures.</p></li>

<li><p>KYI - Know Your Investor (See SEC 506(d)).
<br><br>
You can have up to 34 friends and family as an exemption.</p></li>

<li><p>Accredited Investor. An accredited investor is a person or entity that can
deal with securities not registered with financial authorities by satisfying one
of the requirements regarding income, net worth, asset size, governance status
or professional experience. The term is used by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) under Regulation D to refer to investors who are financially
sophisticated and have a reduced need for the protection provided by regulatory
disclosure filings. Accredited investors include natural individuals, banks,
insurance companies, brokers and trusts.</p></li>

<li><p>Going Public. Going public refers to a private company&rsquo;s initial public
offering (IPO), thus becoming a publicly traded and owned entity. Businesses
usually go public to raise capital in hopes of expanding. Venture capitalists
may use IPOs as an exit strategy (a way of getting out of their investment in a
company).</p></li>

<li><p>Money Laundering. Money laundering is the process of creating the appearance
that large amounts of money obtained from criminal activity, such as drug
trafficking or terrorist activity, originated from a legitimate source. The
money from the illicit activity is considered dirty, and the process &ldquo;launders&rdquo;
the money to make it look clean.</p></li>

<li><p>Cost of &ldquo;going public.&rdquo; Going public is the process of selling shares that
were formerly privately held to new investors for the first time. Otherwise
known as an initial public offering (IPO). Going public is very expensive.
Usually a company today needs $250,000,000.00 in revenue to justify going
public. Before Enron it was common to see companies go public with a revenue of
$10,000,000.00 a year.</p></li>
