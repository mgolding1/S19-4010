How do blockchain wallets work
========================================

## Homework to implement private keys

This homework is to implement private key signature.  This is how a user
keep other people from spending their coins.

## Recent Code Changes

1. All of Assignment 4 code is now under `.../05/bsvr`.
2. The server is changed to be a HTTP server so that a second process, the wallet, can call it and sign transactions.
This means large changed to take some extra command line parameters in `.../05/bsvr/main/main.go` and to
have a running HTTP server.
3. The wallet and it's client code is in `.../05/wallet-client`.

## Overview

The blockchain keeps a "distributed ledger" (DLT) but has no information
on who can update the ledger data.

The wallet is a list of public/private keys that the user keeps
on their computer. The user needs to keep the private key part private.   The private key is used
to digitally sign a message to the blockchain so that the blockchain
knows that the message is valid.  The message tells the blockchain
what to do.  In the simple case the message will tell the blockchain
to send funds from one account to some other account.  For this homework
this is the primary thing that we will be implementing.

I have updated Assignment 4 to include a HTTP server that
will listen for a number of requests.  One of these is a "send-funds-to"
operation.  This operation requires a signed message.   When it
receives a properly signed message it will call the underlying
code from Assignment 4 to send funds form the owners account to
some other account.

This home work is to implement the client code that will keep
a wallet and send messages that are signed to the server.

## To Start the Server

The server is a HTTP server.  You will need to have created a genisis
block.  After that you can run a server on localhost with a port of 9022
with:

```
	$ cd 05/bsvr/main
	$ go build
	$ ./main --server 127.0.0.1:9191
```

You will want to run this in it's own window as it runs until it is
killed or until you send it a shutdown message.

## To call the server from the client.

A client has already been built that has a number of commands in it.
It is in `.../05/wallet-client`.   You can use a browser to enter
the URLs and call the server.   A browser is a complicated set of
software that hides lots of details.  Instead we will just use a 
simple command line client that performs GET requests.

Already Implemented CLI commands.

```
	./wallet-client --cmd echo
	./wallet-client --cmd list-accts
	./wallet-client --cmd shutdown-server
	./wallet-client --cmd server-status
	./wallet-client --cmd acct-value --acct 0x0000Some-Acct-Number
	./wallet-client --cmd new-key-file --password "SomePassword"
	./wallet-client --cmd list-my-accts
```

Your homework CLI commands.

```
	./wallet-client --cmd validate-signed-message \
		--acct 0x000SomeAcct --password PasswordForAcct
	./wallet-client --cmd send-funds-to --form 0x00FromAcct \
		--to 0x00000000ToAcct --password "PasswordOfFrom" \
		--memo "a-memo" --amount  ###
```

| Cmd             |  Description                                                                      |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| echo            | just print out a note that the CLI got called to verify the command lie process.  |
| list-accts      | This works the same as the server version - list the accounts on the server       |
| shutdown-server | send a message to the server to shutdown.                                         |
| server-status   | Find out the status of the server - is it up - is it running.                     |
| acct-value      | find out the value of an account                                                  |
| new-key-file    |  Create a new account - this runs purely locally - no server call                 |
| list-my-accts   | list the accounts in your local wallet.  no server call.                          |

## Homework Overview.

Implement the client side to create and sign messages first.
Add print statements to the server to show that you are
getting the correct data passed from client to server.
Then when you have correct data on the server go and implement
the server signature verify code.   Use the supplied command
line tool, `sig-test` to validate signatures before
you implement the server code.   Use the `sig-test` code
to see what a signature should look like.

## The provided client code.

The sample client code is in `wallet-client`.  It is in the file
`client-main.go`.  This progam is partially complete.
The code that is currently there can:

1. Create a new key file.
2. List keys in the wallet.
3. List the set of accounts that the server has.
4. List the value of an existing account on the server.
5. Make a request to just validate a signature with a random generated message.  This 
will require implementing the serer code to validate signatures.  
This is in the `client-main.go` at line 129.  When you get this to work the
part (5) should be easy.   The randomly generated message will be replace
with the request to send funds.  All the hard work for signing is done.
6. Send a request to the server to send funds from one account to a destination account.
The "sign" message part is missing.  You will need to implement this.
	1. Take the request message in JSON.
	2. Create the `Keccak256` hash of the message string.
	3. Create the signature for the hash in (2) using the users key.
	4. Send the request to the server with `msg`, `msgStr`, `signature`.
This is in the client-main.go at line 133.

## The provided server code.

The server should run and do lots of stuff.  You need to implement the
section where the signature is actually validated.  This is in
`../05/cli/svr-lib.go` line 115.  If the signature is valid and
the message is valid then return `isValid` as true.  If an error occurs,
for example a bad address or some other error during the validation process,
then return `isValid` as false and the error. Most of the code for this part of the 
assignment should be adapted from signMessage.go in sig-test. 

## Helpful things

`.../05/sig-test` has a full command line tool that implements signing
and validation of messages.   95% of the code is pulled form go-ethereum.

## what to submit.

Your code in `.../05/bsvr/cli/*.go` and
`.../05/wallet-client/client-main.go`.
If you create more files for the client then submit those also.





## Notes
1. Uses some library functions to create a public/private key pair. (Implemented for you by the instructor)
2. Lists the set of public/private key pairs in the "wallet.json" file. (Implemented for you by the instructor)
3. Makes a status request to the blockchain to find out if it is up and running.  (Implemented) Do this part first.
4. Updates the password on a public/private key pair.   This is an all-local operation that will not require the blockchain server to be running.
This is optional.  It has not been implemented but it would be useful.  It is in the sample command line tool.
5. Makes a request to a blockchain node with a signed message to transfer funds.  Homework.
6. Makes a request to a remote node to list all the accounts (Implemented for you by the instructor)
7. Makes a request to a remote node to list the value of an accounts (Implemented for you by the instructor)
